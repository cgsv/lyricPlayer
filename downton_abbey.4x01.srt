1
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,430
-我得走了  -当然  去吧
- I'll have to go. - Of course you must go.

2
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,240
谁去把信交给夫人呢
Oh, but who'll give the letter to her ladyship?

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,910
我去吧
Oh, I can do that and

4
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,620
今天由我来服侍夫人用餐更衣
I'll take her breakfast and dress her today,

5
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,020
但这不是长久之计
but I haven't got time to make it a regular thing.

6
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,330
找到替任之前  我来服侍夫人
No, I can do it until she finds someone else.

7
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,780
玛丽小姐不会介意的
Lady Mary won't mind.

8
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,420
-你怎么了  -奥布瑞恩小姐突然走了
- What's the matter with you? - Miss O'Brien's upped and left!

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,570
不可能
Never!

10
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,760
吉米
Jimmy!

11
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,910
吉米  奥布瑞恩小姐走了
Jimmy. Miss O'Brien's gone!

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,520
-什么  去哪了  -我怎么知道
- What? Gone where? - How should I know?

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,630
玛姬  奥布瑞恩走了
Madge, O'Brien's gone.

14
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,700
-你听说了吗  -什么
- Have you heard? - Heard what?

15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,300
-奥布瑞恩小姐走了  -什么叫走了
- Miss O'Brien? She's gone. - What do you mean gone?

16
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,970
-她离开了  -离开
- She's left. - Left?

17
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,440
她打包走人了
She's packed up.

18
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,060
真无法相信
I can't believe it.

19
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,720
我不觉得  像贼一样夜里偷偷出走
I can. Sneaking off like a thief in the night,

20
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,900
真是奥布瑞恩的风格
that's O'Brien to a T.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,820
我是不相信苏珊竟会抢我的人
I just can't believe Susan has done this to me.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,370
奥布瑞恩小姐确实说过
Miss O'Brien did say that

23
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,760
弗林特夏尔夫人与她在苏格兰时
she got on very well with Lady Flintshire

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,950
相处甚欢
when she was up in Scotland.

25
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,540
我想也是
So I gather!

26
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,310
弗林特夏尔夫人已为我订了去印度的车票
"Lady Flintshire has booked my ticket for India

27
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,200
机会难得  错过实在可惜
"And it seems too good a chance to miss."

28
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,810
真的毫无预兆
Was there really no warning?

29
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,820
现在想来  昨天她接到一通电报
Now I think of it, she'd a telegram yesterday.

30
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,710
一定是为这事
That must have been it.

31
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,810
现在怎么办
So what happens now?

32
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,060
今天由我为您更衣  夫人
I'll dress you today, m'lady,

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,270
明天安娜会接手  直到您找到新的贴身女仆
and Anna will take over tomorrow, until you find a replacement.

34
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,780
她真的完全没表露出来吗
And she really gave no clue?

35
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,570
她对我只字未提  卡森先生
She didn't say anything to me, Mr Carson, not a word.

36
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,190
当真如此吗
As long as she didn't.

37
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,530
我知道你们都以为她有说什么  但确实没有
I know you all think she must have said summat, but she didn't.

38
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,670
我信你  可你难以服众啊
I believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

39
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,300
她是我的姨妈  可她心思一向难测
She may be my aunt but she's a dark horse.

40
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,700
这点倒是无人不服
No-one will contradict you there.

41
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,840
苏珊・弗林特夏尔偷了妈妈的女仆
Susan Flintshire has stolen Mama's maid

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,100
她女儿还在我们家作客呢
whilst her daughter's a guest in this house?

43
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,640
她肯定不会这么说
I'm sure she wouldn't put it like that.

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,180
我管她怎么说  这太下作了
I don't care how she puts it. It's absolutely disgraceful.

45
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,170
-没事  玛姬和我说了  -当然有事
- It's all right. Madge told me. - It is NOT all right.

46
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,060
-你真毫不知情吗  -不知道
- Did you have any idea? - No. Not really.

47
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,970
我知道  妈妈觉得
I knew, I knew that Mummy

48
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,900
奥布瑞恩很会做头发
thought O'Brien was very good at doing hair,

49
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,850
他们还说过  奥布瑞恩想去旅行
and they talked about her wanting to travel...

50
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,540
-什么时候  -你们在唐伊阁的时候
- What? When? - When you were all at Duneagle.

51
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,550
你竟然没告诉我们
And you didn't think to inform us?

52
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,850
我明天去伦敦  可以在《女士》杂志上登则广告
I'm in London tomorrow. I can put an advertisement in The Lady.

53
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,950
很好
Good.

54
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,270
等杂志刊登信息会不会要很久
Won't it take forever, waiting for the magazine to come out?

55
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,740
这也没办法
It can't be helped.

56
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,200
我们十一点要见特伦特
We're meeting Trent at eleven.

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,460
到时见  我想先去种植园走走
I'll see you there. I want to walk the plantations first.

58
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,800
不知道玛丽想不想一起去
I was wondering if Mary might like to come.

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,270
别打扰玛丽  她够烦的了
Don't bother Mary. She's got enough on her plate.

60
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,440
你真的什么都不知道
Did you really not know anything?

61
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,630
我没想到她真会这么做
I never thought she'd go through with it.

62
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,800
我想您该带上这件
I thought you might like to take this down with you.

63
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,700
要是您想出去走走  外头挺冷的
In case you want a walk. It's quite chilly.

64
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,100
黑色那件呢
Where's the black one?

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,990
我带乔治少爷去散散步  小姐
I'm taking Master George out for some air, m'lady,

66
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,430
您要一起来吗
and I wondered if you'd like to come with us.

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,840
不了  谢谢
I don't think so, but thank you.

68
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,040
可怜的小孤儿
Poor little orphan.

69
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,710
谢谢  保姆
Thank you, Nanny.

70
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,640
他不是孤儿  他有母亲
He's not an orphan. He's got his mother.

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,910
孤儿没有
Orphans haven't.

72
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,360
要这么说  他也不可怜[穷]
He isn't poor either, come to that.

73
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,010
您不介意我照顾夫人吧
And you don't mind my seeing to her ladyship?

74
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,140
为何介意  我又没打算环游世界
Why would I mind? I'm not planning a trip round the world.

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,260
莫斯利先生  你看见崔维斯先生了吗
Mr Molesley. Have you seen Mr Travis?

76
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,520
我要和他谈慈善集市的事
I need to speak to him about the Bring and Buy Sale.

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,650
没见着  夫人
I'm afraid not, your ladyship.

78
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,760
好吧
Never mind.

79
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,170
真是令人伤感啊
This were a sad business.

80
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,550
悲伤之极
Very, very sad.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,930
真不敢相信  已经到立碑的时候了
I can't believe it's time for the stone already.

82
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,250
六个月了
Six months.

83
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,150
安顿坟墓需要六个月
They always leave six months for the grave to settle.

84
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,360
你儿子找到新工作了吗
Tell me has, has your son found another job, yet?

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,370
没  夫人
No, m'lady.

86
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,430
他们留下他了
They've let him stay on

87
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,010
他也总是很努力
and he always tries to make himself useful,

88
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,290
但也不能长久如此
but it can't go on forever

89
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,480
而且  他还没了薪水
and anyway, he's lost his wage.

90
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,490
但他是个训练有素的贴身男仆
But he's a properly trained valet.

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,350
还可以当个管家
He could even be a butler.

92
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,050
我倒希望如此  夫人
I hope so, m'lady...

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,260
但世道多变啊
..But it's a changing world.

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
这点我清楚得很
You don't have to tell me.

95
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,280
你好啊
Hello.

96
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,940
你很快就能走路了  小姐
It'll soon be time for you to get out and walk, young lady.

97
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,400
请不要在未经我允许的情况下碰这孩子
Please don't touch the children, not without my permission.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
什么
What?

99
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,780
照看他们是我的责任  再小心也不为过
They are in my charge and I cannot be too careful.

100
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,820
你可别忘了  我认识这孩子的母亲
I would remind you that I knew this young girl's mother,

101
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,400
跟你不一样
which you never did.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,670
那并不代表你是她的朋友
That doesn't make you her friend.

103
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,420
我确实是她的朋友
As a matter of fact, it does.

104
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,480
我没时间跟你拌嘴
Well, I can't stay here to bandy words.

105
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,120
你能不能转告帕特莫太太
Will you ask Mrs Patmore

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,010
让她在半小时内备好孩子的午餐
to send up the children's luncheon in half an hour?

107
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,720
你自己跟她说吧
Ask her yourself, why don't you?

108
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,850
夫人是不是很失望
Was her ladyship very disappointed?

109
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,410
是  而且得一阵子才能找到合适的人选
She was, and it'll take quite a while to find a replacement.

110
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,990
真没想到奥布瑞恩小姐这么欠考虑
I can't believe Miss O'Brien would be so thoughtless.

111
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,840
出乎意料吗  我倒不觉得
Can't you? I can.

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,290
她想出去冒险  这有什么不妥的
She wants an adventure. What's wrong with that?

113
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,250
反正我不怪她
I don't blame her.

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,230
她可以离开
Not for wanting to go,

115
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,340
但别突然就跑了  让大家措手不及
but why run off and leave us in the lurch?

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,970
你这么说是想让大家觉得你事先也不知情吧
You're talking like that so we'll think you didn't know.

117
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,550
怎么能这么说呢
That's not kind!

118
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,160
拉着个脸有什么用  祝她好运
What's the good of a month of sour looks? Good luck to her.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,090
-玛丽小姐今早怎么样  -还是老样子
- How was Lady Mary this morning? - The same.

120
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,700
她最终会走出来吧
But, I suppose she must come out of it eventually.

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,090
起码也要为乔治少爷考虑一下
For Master George's sake, if for no other reason.

122
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,030
但愿如此
I hope so.

123
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,100
她现在把一切都交给维斯特保姆了
Right now, she prefers to leave it all to Nanny West.

124
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,340
保姆的工作我可做不来
I couldn't be a nanny.

125
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,330
为什么  你不喜欢孩子吗
Why not? Don't you like children?

126
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,550
喜欢是喜欢
No, I do.

127
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,790
但做了保姆的话
Being a nanny

128
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,840
既不算家里人  又不算仆人
you're not one of the family but not one of us either.

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,770
-你们在聊什么呢  -做保姆
- What are you talking about? - Being a nanny.

130
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,810
黛西说那种生活一定很孤独
Daisy was saying she thinks it must be a lonely life.

131
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,930
这我倒不知道
I don't know about that.

132
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,870
不过要我说  那个维斯特保姆实在是自恃过高了
But if you ask me, that Nanny West thinks too much of herself.

133
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,940
她怎么了  她一向对我挺好的
Why? What's she done? She always seems nice to me.

134
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,840
她就会对我颐指气使
She only tried to give me orders.

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,080
你是说她把你当成仆人了
You mean she mistook you for a servant?

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,170
-但他就是个仆人  -这话可别跟他说
- But he IS a servant. - Don't tell him that.

137
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,200
他可承受不了这个打击
He'll never get over the shock!

138
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,770
多谢了  马什先生
Thank you, Mr Marsh.

139
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,410
他失望也在所难免
He was bound to be disappointed.

140
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,550
你真的要放弃整个计划吗
You're really sure you want to abandon the whole plan?

141
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,140
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

142
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,030
有一半的地产都要缴继承税
We have to find the death duties on half the estate.

143
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,210
-后果一定不堪设想  -我知道
- And they'll be merciless. - I know.

144
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,710
不过我希望我们能等玛丽回来参与处理这事
But, I wish we could wait for Mary to come back into play.

145
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,320
这本来就不关她的事
She isn't a player.

146
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,540
她生前可以享有马修在唐顿
She has a life interest in one third of Matthew's share of Downton,

147
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,060
和其他地方财产的三分之一
and a third of his other possessions,

148
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,410
但其他的财产都归乔治所有
but everything else belongs to little George.

149
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,900
法律规定她只能继承这么一点吗  
And that's all the law gives her?

150
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,800
他该起草一份遗嘱的
He should have made a will.

151
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,730
但玛丽是乔治的监护人
But, Mary's George's guardian.

152
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,910
这难道不能给她点话语权吗
Surely that gives her some sort of say?

153
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,380
说不准
It's a moot point.

154
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,560
既然所有财产的一半都归我所有
Since I own the other half of everything,

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,260
由我来管理孩子的财产不是更合适吗
isn't it more appropriate for me to manage the boy's fortunes?

156
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,640
更何况她现在这么脆弱
Besides, she's in such a fragile state,

157
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,470
我真不想让她为财产的事烦心
the last thing I want is for her to start worrying about money.

158
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,850
话虽这么说  但您不觉得...  
Of course. But you don't think...?

159
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,190
你知道她是什么样子
You've seen her!

160
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,650
她连吃饭的力气都没有
She hardly has the energy to lift a fork to her mouth.

161
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,270
她很爱他
She loved him very much.

162
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,900
真爱的代价就是其中一方之死所带来的巨大痛苦
And the price of great love is great misery when one of you dies.

163
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,230
-我知道  -是的
- I know that. - Of course you do.

164
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,650
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

165
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,210
咱们快点回去吧  别耽误了吃午饭
We better get back or we'll be late for lunch.

166
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,260
您知道我登了广告的  卡森先生
I've placed advertisements, Mr Carson, you know I have.

167
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,950
-没有合适的吗  -根本没有回音
- But the answers weren't suitable? - I didn't get any answers.

168
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,270
倒不是完全没有  但我回信之后就没有回音了
Well, I did, but when I wrote back, I heard nothing more.

169
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,270
我不知该说些什么了
Well, I don't know what to suggest.

170
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,830
因为  我不能留在这吗
Because, I can't stay here?

171
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,240
莫斯利先生  我不想显得无理
Mr Molesley, I should hate us to appear inhospitable.

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,540
但我不能留在这儿
But I can't stay here.

173
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,430
这对老爷来说公平吗  毕竟都六个月了
Is it fair on his lordship? It has been six months.

174
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,080
我可以去我爸爸那儿  再想办法
I suppose I could go to my dad's until I get something sorted.

175
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,770
好主意
What a good idea.

176
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,150
-午饭准备好了  -谢谢你  帕特莫太太
- Servants' lunch is on the table. - Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

177
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,620
高兴点  莫斯利先生  事情还没定下来呢
Oh cheer up, Mr Molesley. It may never happen.

178
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,060
已经成定局了
It already has.

179
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,300
我午餐后要去瑟斯克  你要一起去吗
By the way, I'm going into Thirsk after lunch. Do you want to come?

180
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,410
我要去村里  看看伊泽贝尔怎么样了
I'm walking down to the village to see how Isobel's getting on.

181
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,180
跟她说  随时可以来
Remind her it's an open invitation,

182
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,480
她要是想看看孙子
if she wants to see her grandson

183
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,030
或是想找人陪陪她  只要过来就行
or feels like company, she just has to turn up.

184
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,980
我会转告她的
I'll tell her.

185
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,880
-我可能会和你一起去  -还是别了
- I might come with you. - I don't think so.

186
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,850
我觉得她可能不想见到太多人
I don't think she's up to seeing many people.

187
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,720
我只是想去村里而已
I only meant into the village.

188
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,970
伊迪丝 你明天真的要去伦敦吗
Edith, are you really going to London tomorrow?

189
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,050
如果你去  我正好有事让你帮我办
I have a couple of errands if you are.

190
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,910
我要去见迈克尔・格莱格森
I'm seeing Michael Gregson.

191
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,210
你留在这里的日子  他一定想死你了
He must have missed you while you've been here.

192
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,970
他要举办一个宴会  把我介绍给他文学圈的朋友
He's giving a party to introduce me to his literary friends.

193
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,890
真令人期待  是不是  罗伯特
How exciting. Isn't it, Robert?

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
我可不可以放一张卡片在你的橱窗里
I... I was wondering if I might put a card in your window.

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,820
-什么样的卡片  小姐  -工作招人的卡片
- A card, m'lady? - For a job asking for applicants.

196
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,480
是什么样的工作呢
And what sort of job might this be?

197
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,530
怎么  这还有什么区别吗
Why? Does it make a difference?

198
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,730
-不  并没有  -谢谢你了
- No, I suppose not. - Thank you.

199
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,420
-我该付你多少钱呢  -六便士就好
- Erm, how much will that be? - Sixpence should cover it.

200
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,480
你真应该多去看看乔治
You ought to see more of George.

201
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,880
可怜的乔治
Poor George.

202
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,020
一出生就命途多舛
What a burden he is born into.

203
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,670
身家阔绰  妈妈却形如枯槁
A baby rich as Croesus and a mother almost passed over.

204
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,980
法律就是如此
That's the law.

205
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,180
感觉好奇怪
It seems so strange.

206
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,330
马修一向谨小慎微
Matthew was always so meticulous.

207
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,540
他以为死亡离他还早得很
He thought that death was many years away.

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700
本来也应该如此
And so it should have been.

209
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,390
如果有什么我能帮忙的  请尽管开口
If there's anything I can do to help, please let me do it.

210
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,200
我很感激
I'm grateful.

211
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,080
但是你看  如果你的独子过世了
But you see, when your only child dies...

212
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,790
你就不再是一个母亲了
..Then you're not a mother any more.

213
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,870
你就什么也不是了
You're not anything, really.

214
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,910
我在努力适应这一点
That's what I'm trying to get used to.

215
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,800
你也是一位祖母
You're a grandmother.

216
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,600
我知道你一定会是位出色的祖母
And I know you're going to be a wonderful one.

217
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,190
-下午送来的信  -谢谢
- Afternoon post. - Ah, thank you.

218
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,560
怎么又这样
Oh, not this again.

219
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,760
怎么了
Not what?

220
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,660
没什么
Oh...nothing!

221
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,600
家具商来了就通知我一声
Let me know when the upholsterer arrives.

222
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,220
你布置工作的时候  我也要在场
I want to be there when you explain the job in hand.

223
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,150
好呀  不过我一人就能办好了
Very well, but I can easily manage.

224
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,950
得让他知道挂毯有多贵重
He needs to grasp the quality of the tapestry on the chairs,

225
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,270
免得他冒冒失失地往上钉钉子
before he starts slamming nails into them.

226
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,690
难道我就交代不明白吗
And I couldn't make him see that?

227
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,660
招工  贴身女仆  会女红和梳头

228
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,990
我们关门了  亲爱的
Just closing, love.

229
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,900
我只想知道是谁在找贴身女仆
I only wanted to know who was looking for a lady's maid.

230
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,880
在唐顿  也只有那几个需要找贴身女仆的
There's not too many in Downton who need a lady's maid.

231
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,330
你是指庄园的人吗 
You mean the Abbey?

232
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,160
你以前不是在那里干过吗
Didn't you used to work there?

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,040
我干过  但我后来去学东西了
I did, but I've been studying since then.

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,140
-学什么  -学习如何做贴身女仆
- Studying for what? - To become a lady's maid.

235
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,570
玛姬说伊迪丝小姐下午去看望了卡劳利夫人
Madge says that Lady Edith saw Mrs Crawley this afternoon.

236
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,560
-她还好吗  -恐怕是非常不好  
- How is she? - In a very dark place, I'm afraid.

237
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,890
这也难怪
And no wonder.

238
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,440
一个寡妇  又失去了独子
For a widowed mother to lose an only son...

239
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,480
没有比您更合适去安慰她的人了
There's no more fit person to comfort her than you.

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,890
是吗
I wonder.

241
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,890
如果茜玻小姐是我的独女  我怕是活不下去了
If Lady Sybil had been an only child I believe I'd have died.

242
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,220
不  夫人  您会为孩子好好活下去
No, m'lady. You would have lived on for the baby.

243
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,940
她也一样
And so must she.

244
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,460
谢谢你  休斯太太  晚安了
Thank you so much, Mrs Hughes, and good night to you.

245
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,070
晚安  夫人
Good night, m'lady.

246
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,430
老爷
M'lord.

247
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,450
你还好吧
Are you all right?

248
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,310
我觉得我们得定下来
I feel we must settle the question

249
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,270
由谁来打理孩子的财产
of who is to manage the baby's property.

250
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,220
我不想催促玛丽
I don't want to hurry Mary before she's ready.

251
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,500
这有什么可争论的
What question?

252
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,560
她是乔治的妈妈和监护人啊
She's George's mother and his guardian.

253
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,020
当然了
Of course she is,

254
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,550
但是涉及到关于庄园的决定
but when it comes to decisions about the estate,

255
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,850
我来不是更妥当吗
shouldn't it be me?

256
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,880
为什么
Why?

257
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,550
因为我和我的外孙共同拥有六分之五的唐顿
Because, together, my grandson and I own five sixths of Downton.

258
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,370
而玛丽的部分只是有生之年享有
Mary's share is only for her life.

259
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,870
即使她想  也做不了什么
She couldn't do much with it even if she wanted to.

260
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,840
重要的是  因为遗传税的缘故
The point being that with the death duties we're facing,

261
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,420
我们要做出一些重要的决定
there are some big decisions ahead.

262
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,830
你要把玛丽挤出去吗
You want to push Mary out.

263
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,630
我不是要挤她  她本来也没有决定权
I'm not pushing her out. She was never "In."

264
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,630
马修是共同所有人  如今他儿子是
Matthew was co-owner and now his son is.

265
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,400
我曾跟马修共同努力  如今我要为他的儿子努力
I worked with Matthew. I must work for his boy.

266
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,130
谢谢
Thanks.

267
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,390
周二居然有这么多信
A lot of letters for a Tuesday.

268
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,780
这一周刚刚开始  大家哪来的时间写信啊
How do people have time to write when the week is just beginning?

269
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,210
今天是情人节
It's Saint Valentine's Day.

270
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,950
你居然记得这日子  而我却忘了
Oh, imagine your remembering that and my forgetting it.

271
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,640
这谁能想得到啊
Who would have thought such a thing?

272
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,300
我也不是完全不懂浪漫
I am not a complete stranger to romance

273
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,270
如果你是这个意思的话
if that's what you're implying.

274
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,700
或许现在是吧  但也不一直是如此
Maybe I am now, but I wasn't always.

275
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,550
等等  我以为这都是账单呢
Hold on. I thought these were all bills.

276
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,170
黛茜  这封是给你的
Daisy! This one's for you.

277
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,860
黛茜  是谁寄的啊
Daisy? Who's that from?

278
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,850
别取笑她  巴罗先生
Don't tease her, Mr Barrow.

279
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,640
谁给你寄了卡片
Who sent you a card?

280
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,340
我也不知道  上面没有签名
I don't know. It's not signed.

281
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,900
我的也是  看来我们俩都有暗恋者
Nor's mine. We both must have secret admirers.

282
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,070
这也不奇怪嘛
Which is no more than we deserve.

283
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,170
差不多行了  贝茨先生  还有活儿要干呢
That's enough of that, Mr. Bates. We've work to do.

284
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,080
看什么呢
What's that?

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,050
没什么
Nothing.

286
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,090
是啊  今天是情人节
Of course. It's Valentine's Day.

287
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,920
你什么时候去伦敦
When are you leaving for London?

288
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,580
十点钟的火车
I'm catching the ten o'clock.

289
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,990
我该去收拾了
I ought to pack.

290
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,510
玩得开心
Have a happy time.

291
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,640
里彭  中央济贫院

292
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,870
上帝是仁慈的

293
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,190
就是那个
Just down there.

294
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,880
格里格先生
Mr. Grigg?

295
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,820
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

296
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,510
你写信给唐顿庄园的查理・卡森
You wrote to Charlie Carson at Downton Abbey.

297
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,340
我们一起工作
I work with him.

298
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,340
是他派你来的吗
Did he send you?

299
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,470
也不尽然
Not exactly. In a way.

300
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,380
他都说我什么了
What... What did he say about me?

301
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,470
他打算怎么办
What does he plan to do?

302
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,220
卡森先生是个大忙人
Mr. Carson is very busy.

303
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,330
他想让我来看看你现在情况如何
He wanted me to find out how you are.

304
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,470
然后  他才能有所打算
Then, I think he'll come up with a plan.

305
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,530
我就知道
I knew it.

306
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,960
上一次见面  他说了许多伤人的话
He said some harsh things when we last met,

307
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,690
但查理和我  我们交情很深
but, we go back a long way, Charlie and me.

308
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,010
所以无论发生什么
And whatever's happened,

309
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,060
当年在戏班子结下的交情  终归还在的
to theatre folk like us, that means something.

310
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,750
是啊  我也这么想
Yes, I'm sure it does.

311
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,370
谢谢  女士  谢谢
Thank you, Madam. Thank you.

312
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,090
这么贴心
This is very lovely.

313
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,960
你这会儿不该在办公室吗
Shouldn't you be at the office?

314
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,850
罗斯孟德姑妈都派车来了
Aunt Rosamund's sending her car.

315
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,250
我很想你
I've missed you.

316
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,730
每时每刻  我都在想你
I haven't stopped thinking about you for one moment.

317
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,990
我不是来了吗
Well, I'm here now.

318
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,280
我听到了一些消息  让我非常激动
I couldn't be more thrilled because I've got some news...

319
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,920
也算不上消息  算是个想法吧
Well, not news, more an idea.

320
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,070
说来听听
Go on.

321
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,420
我研究了一下
I've done some research,

322
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,970
发现并非所有国家都如英格兰一般
and discovered not every country is the same as England.

323
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,120
真是大发现啊
You amaze me.

324
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,620
不  我是说在其他国家
No, I mean there are places

325
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,670
精神失常可以作为离婚的理由
where lunacy is grounds for divorce,

326
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,500
像在葡萄牙  希腊  还有德国
Portugal and Greece and even Germany.

327
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,850
但是  那得是当地居民才行吧
But, wouldn't you have to live there?

328
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,250
不  不  我只是粗浅地了解了一下
No, no, I'm just finding out what's involved.

329
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,240
但如果我真的移民德国  你会和我一起去吗
But if I did live in Germany, would you come with me?

330
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,230
你好  伯恩斯
Oh. Hello, Burns.

331
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,100
这位是伯恩斯  罗斯孟德姑妈的司机
This is Burns, Aunt Rosamund's chauffeur.

332
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,860
下午好  小姐
Good afternoon, m'lady.

333
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,930
需要载你一程吗
Can I give you a lift?

334
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,870
不了  我坐出租就好  方向不同
No, I'll take a taxi. It's the opposite direction.

335
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,380
那晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

336
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,260
是我来得太早了吗
Oh. Am I too early?

337
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,350
不是  是下午茶上晚了
No. I'm afraid tea was a little late.

338
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,600
天呐  你能应付得来吗  要不要我帮忙
Oh, dear. Can you manage? Should I give you a hand?

339
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,820
我能行  谢谢  维斯特小姐
I can manage, thank you, Miss West.

340
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,650
快来  小宝贝
Come to me, darling.

341
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,940
你好啊
Hello.

342
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,260
您的小王子来了  小姐
Now, here's the little Prince, m'lady.

343
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,280
您瞧他看到您有多高兴啊
See how happy he is to see his beautiful Mama?

344
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
上帝保佑他
God bless him.

345
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,940
谢谢你  保姆
Thank you, Nanny.

346
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,620
你说你失去了人生的目标
You say you have no purpose,

347
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,580
可小乔治怎么办
but what about little George?

348
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,530
你肯定很关心他的
Surely you're interested in him?

349
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,020
当然  但我不想多插手  让玛丽不悦
Of course, but I'm not going to drive Mary mad by interfering.

350
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,270
做奶奶的就得插手
It's the job of grandmothers to interfere.

351
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,690
是莫斯利来了
Oh, that's Molesley.

352
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,910
他想见我  所以我们约好了时间
He asked to see me and I told him when he could come.

353
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,150
是吗  我能留下吗
Oh? Well, may I stay?

354
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,060
还是你有秘密任务要安排
Or is it a secret assignation?

355
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,910
很抱歉打扰二位夫人了
Oh. I'm very sorry to interrupt your ladyship.

356
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,450
找我什么事  莫斯利
What is it, Molesley?

357
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,780
我想问问您  能否考虑让我重新回来工作
I came to ask if you'd consider giving me my old job back.

358
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,390
不好意思  打扰你们谈私事了
I apologise for forcing myself on a private conversation.

359
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,140
我这就走
I will go.

360
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,980
请别走  夫人  没什么秘密可言
No please, m'lady. There's no mystery.

361
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,380
因为那件事  我丢了工作
I've lost my job, because, well, for obvious reasons

362
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,490
所以我想能不能回来工作
and I thought I'd ask here.

363
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,610
问题是  我并不需要管家
The trouble is, I have no need for a butler.

364
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,080
如今我只是个用托盘吃饭的老寡妇
These days I'm just an old widow who eats off a tray.

365
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,930
我明白
I see.

366
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,780
不能因为自己是个老寡妇
Just because you're an old widow,

367
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,330
就用托盘吃饭啊
I see no necessity to eat off a tray.

368
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,990
我们俩可是不是同一种人
You and I are different.

369
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,360
没错  这话不假
Yes, that is very true.

370
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,570
浪费您的时间了
I'm wasting your time.

371
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,900
要是有空缺的职位
Should, should we hear of an opening...

372
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,690
我们应该上哪找你呢
..where would we find you?

373
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,110
我会搬去我父亲那儿  夫人
I'm moving to my father's house, m'lady.

374
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,130
你有想过我对你说的话吗
Have you had any more time to think about what I said?

375
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,540
你是说我们罪恶地生活在一起
You mean our living in sin?

376
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,220
如果我离婚了  就不算罪恶了
We'd only live in sin as you call it, until the divorce.

377
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,780
你不想跟我在一起吗
Don't you want to be with me?

378
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,370
你知道我想的  求之若渴
You know I do. More than anything.

379
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,570
还有杜松子酒吗  先生  快喝完了
Erm, is there any more gin, sir? We're running rather low.

380
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,070
好的  我...我去看看
Yes, I'll er, I'll have a look.

381
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,620
上帝啊
Oh, my Lord!

382
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,010
不胜荣幸  老夫人
This is an honour, your ladyship.

383
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,830
我给你儿子捎个话
I have a message for your son.

384
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,260
沙克尔顿夫人要来与我共进午宴
Lady Shackleton is joining me for luncheon.

385
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,230
我想让他过来帮忙
I want him to come and help.

386
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,360
那斯普拉特先生呢
But, what about Mr Spratt?

387
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,470
斯普拉特当然也在
Well, Spratt will be there, of course,

388
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,980
但莫斯利还是可以帮忙嘛
but Molesley can still take an active part.

389
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,510
沙克尔顿夫人告诉我说她的管家要退休了
Lady Shackleton tells me her butler is retiring.

390
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,740
那她不是要想办法另寻他人吗
Won't she have made arrangements to find another?

391
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,320
关键就在这里
But that is the point.

392
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,910
她还没有决定是否要找人接替他
She hasn't yet decided whether to replace him or not,

393
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,950
所以要是莫斯利能够一展身手的话...
so if Molesley can demonstrate his skills...

394
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,650
斯普拉特先生不介意吗
Mr Spratt won't mind?

395
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,790
还轮不到他来介意
It is not his business to mind.

396
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,600
那是当然  那么...
No. Well...

397
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,400
好的  夫人  非常感谢
Very good, m'lady. Thank you very much.

398
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
我已经把那封信揉成一团扔掉了
You took a letter out of my waste paper basket

399
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,650
你竟然还把它从我的废纸篓里捡了出来
when I had clearly crumpled it and thrown it away?

400
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,020
我知道你不开心了
I could see it had upset you.

401
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,040
我想知道为什么
I wanted to know why.

402
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,440
那是自然
I'm sure.

403
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,660
但你有没有想过
But it didn't occur to you

404
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,820
你或许不该操心我为什么不开心
it might not be your concern WHY I was upset?

405
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,520
不管怎样  我操了心  读了信
Well, anyway, I did it and I read it

406
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,910
我还去见了他
and I went to see him!

407
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,850
你难道不想知道他境况如何吗
Don't you want to know how he is?

408
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,040
我要是想知道的话  我就回信给他了
If I wanted to know how he is, I would have answered his letter.

409
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,020
卡森先生  他在济贫院里
Mr Carson, he's in the workhouse!

410
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,740
如果你想知道
And in case you're wondering,

411
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,900
那里就跟狄更斯的小说里描述的一样糟糕
it's as bad as if we were reading about it in a novel by Dickens.

412
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,380
济贫院不是应该都已经关闭了吗
Haven't they closed the workhouses?

413
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,270
没有  还留下来了一些
No. They haven't. Not all of them.

414
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,370
起码雨淋不着他
Well, at least he's in the dry.

415
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,730
雨倒是淋不着他
If you can call it dry

416
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,110
可是那里的每一寸空气都弥漫着霉味
when there's mould in the very air you breathe.

417
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,540
这个男人曾经跟你一起唱歌跳舞
This is a man you sang and danced with.

418
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,230
你真的无动于衷吗
Do you feel nothing?

419
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,680
我想我帮不上忙
I don't feel I could be helpful, no.

420
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,130
而且那是我想要忘掉的一段时光
And I would thank you not to remind me

421
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,380
我希望你不要再提
of a time in my life I prefer to forget.

422
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,310
可我们为什么需要这个
But why would we need it?

423
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,800
这是个搅拌机  可以打蛋  搅奶油什么的
It's a mixer. It beats eggs and whips cream and all sorts.

424
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,190
可那是你跟艾薇的活儿
But you and Ivy do that!

425
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,310
我们可巴不得不干那活儿呢
And we'd be glad not to, thank you very much.

426
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,930
伊迪丝小姐有没有说为什么买这个
Did Lady Edith say why she got it?

427
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,600
夫人让她买的
Her ladyship asked her to.

428
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,720
她想让我们省点力气
She wants to save us a bit of elbow grease.

429
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,830
你们两个傻丫头
You don't understand!

430
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,250
要不了多久
Before too long,

431
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,050
夫人就可以随便找个村妇来管厨房了
her ladyship could run the kitchen with a woman from the village.

432
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,010
这些面包机啊
What with these toasters and

433
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,430
搅拌机啊什么的  要害我们失业了
mixers and such like, we'd be out of a job.

434
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,370
-我想试试嘛  -那随你的便
- I want to try it. - Then on your own head be it!

435
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,130
你喜欢你的卡片吗  艾薇
Did you like your card, Ivy?

436
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,050
关你什么事
What's it to you?

437
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,390
这还不明显
That'd be telling.

438
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,020
别听他的  他在逗你呢
Don't listen. He's just teasing.

439
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,150
好啦  你们俩走开  该干活了
Come on. Clear out, you two. There's work to be done.

440
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,130
你觉得是不是吉米寄的卡片
Do you think that means that Jimmy sent it?

441
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,310
没准他只是觉得逗我们很好玩吧
Maybe he thinks it fun to tease.

442
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,730
但是  你想过没有
But, don't you see?

443
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,220
如果我的是吉米寄的  那你的是谁寄的
If Jimmy sent mine, then who sent yours?

444
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,220
-托马斯  -你该叫巴罗先生
- Thomas? - Mr Barrow to you.

445
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,940
你能不能跟帕特莫太太说一声
Can you tell Mrs Patmore

446
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,310
茜玻小姐的茶点不要炒蛋
I won't want the scrambled egg for Miss Sybbie's tea.

447
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,350
你从这里走  下楼梯
If you go through here and down the stairs,

448
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,630
就能自己跟她说了
you can tell her yourself.

449
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,690
拜托帮个忙  我忙的不可开交
Do it. Please. I can't stop.

450
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,610
孩子们没人看呢
The children are on their own.

451
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,310
既然罗斯打算去找人
Why did I struggle across

452
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,590
我去伦敦跑腿做什么
London if Rose was going to sort it out?

453
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,510
你还有别的事情要做
You had other things to do.

454
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,330
那也不是罗斯在邮局窗口放广告卡的理由
It doesn't explain why rose put the card in the Post Office window.

455
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,240
我只是觉得如果能找个当地人
I just thought how much quicker

456
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,530
那大概会快得多
it would be if we could find someone local.

457
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,070
我觉得我有责任这么做
I do feel responsible.

458
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,580
你收到任何回复了吗
Have you had any answers yet?

459
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,530
我们收到了三个  其中一个很不错
We've had three and one's promising,

460
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,690
我们会在周五去里彭见她
so we'll see her in Ripon on Friday.

461
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,430
为什么她不来这里
Why isn't she coming here?

462
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,190
她要照顾姨妈  走不开
She's looking after her aunt, she can't get away.

463
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,090
你该回到我们身边来了
It's time for you to come back to us.

464
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,000
你有什么建议
What would you suggest?

465
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,420
找点感兴趣的事情  不管什么事
Take an interest in something, doesn't matter what.

466
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,330
诗歌...或者木艺
Poetry...or carpentry.

467
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,300
-历史或者帽子  -我对乔治感兴趣
- History or hats. - I'm interested in George.

468
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,380
是吗
Are you?

469
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,040
我会的
I will be.

470
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,870
你今天都干了些什么
What have you been doing today?

471
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,170
就是修理车间的各种事情
Well, it's this whole business with the repair shop.

472
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,240
汤姆  别拿那些无聊的事情烦她
Tom, don't bore her with all that nonsense.

473
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,830
-是我的错  我先问他的  -即便如此
- It's my fault. I asked. - Even so.

474
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,820
你要做的就是开心起来
You concentrate on feeling better.

475
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,930
你不必为其他任何事操心
You mustn't worry about anything else.

476
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,380
你寄了情人节贺卡吗
Did you send a Valentine's card?

477
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,340
或许吧
Suppose I did.

478
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,720
-是给艾薇的吗  -这不管你的事
- Was it to Ivy? - That's my business.

479
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,890
你不会真给艾薇寄了卡片吧
You didn't really send Ivy a card?

480
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,380
有可能吗
Is it likely?

481
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,790
我给安斯特拉瑟老夫人寄了一张
I sent one to Lady Anstruther.

482
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,650
我之前在她那儿工作
I used to worked for her

483
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,080
听说她要从法国回来了
and I heard she's coming back from France.

484
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,560
或许能用上她
She might be useful.

485
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,010
你这样会不会太唐突了
Wasn't that a bit forward?

486
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,560
我觉得她不会介意的
Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

487
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,090
说实话  休斯太太
To be honest, Mrs Hughes,

488
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,000
我认为这事与我毫无关系
I don't see that it's any of my business.

489
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,960
真没料到您会说出这种话  夫人
That's something I never thought I'd hear you say, ma'am.

490
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,560
一个在济贫院的可怜人 
A wretched man is in the workhouse

491
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,480
他向我们求助
and he reaches out to us for rescue.

492
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
他是向卡森求助
Well, he reached out to Carson.

493
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,500
我不知道你想让我做什么
I don't see what you want me to do.

494
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,280
卡劳利夫人  我
Mrs Crawley, I...

495
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,060
我在想能否把他带到这来
I wondered if I could bring him here.

496
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,770
这里
Here?

497
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,770
如果我俩能向当局替他作担保
If you and I were to vouch for him to the authorities,

498
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,180
就一定能把他从那地方弄出来
I'm sure we could get him away from that place.

499
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,410
可为什么带到这儿来  为什么不是唐顿
But why here? Why not the Abbey?

500
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,930
照顾他不该是卡森的责任吗
Isn't he Carson's responsibility?

501
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,970
可遗憾的是
I'm sorry to say it, but,

502
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,250
卡森先生已经对他的老伙计弃之不顾了
Mr Carson has turned his back on his old pal.

503
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,660
我明白了
I see.

504
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,580
所以即使会激怒卡森你也要把他救出来
So you want to risk Carson's wrath by rescuing this Mr Grigg?

505
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,950
他是个可怜的家伙  但还有工作的能力
He's a pitiful being, but he's not beyond work.

506
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,560
如果他有机会还是能过上体面的生活的
He's not beyond a decent life, if he could find it.

507
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,020
可依我现在的情况  恐怕无力...
You see, in my present state, I don't think I'm strong enough...

508
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,770
您可以的  夫人
But you are, ma'am!

509
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,550
只要您能化悲伤为力量
If you could just set aside your grief,

510
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,580
去帮助有需要的人
and use that strength for another's good.

511
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,170
-布兰森先生  -卡森先生
- Mr Branson. - Mr Carson.

512
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,710
我知道你不会认可
I know you won't think it correct,

513
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,820
但我有个难处得求你帮忙
but I need to ask your help in a difficult situation.

514
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,430
求我帮忙  先生 
My help, sir?

515
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,180
格兰瑟姆伯爵不同意我这么做
Lord Grantham is against me in this.

516
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,630
马修走了  没人能帮我了
With Matthew gone, I've no-one else to turn to.

517
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,500
玛丽  玛丽小姐的情况丝毫没有好转
Mary, that is, Lady Mary, is not improving.

518
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,440
-她受的打击太大了  -没错
- She's suffered a terrible tragedy. - Of course.

519
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,350
可已经过去六个月了
But it's six months now,

520
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,360
而她没比他刚走一周时好多少
and she's no better than she was a week after he died.

521
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,070
唯一的办法就是转移她的注意力
The only way is for her to find an interest outside of herself,

522
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,840
我认为可以让她来打理庄园
and I know that should be in the running of the estate.

523
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,040
老爷的想法呢
What does his lordship think?

524
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,230
格兰瑟姆伯爵认为亲自打点一切
Lord Grantham thinks his duty is to protect Mary and her son

525
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,030
来保护玛丽和她儿子是他的职责
by managing everything himself.

526
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,790
而且在这件事上他听不进你的话
And he won't listen to you on the subject?

527
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,610
他还把她看做是一个小姑娘
He sees her as a little woman,

528
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,660
不该承受现实残酷的折磨
who shouldn't be troubled by anything so harsh as reality.

529
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,490
就算我同意你的看法
And even were I to agree with you...

530
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,710
我又能帮上什么忙呢
..How could I help?

531
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,060
给她点建议  她会听你的
Give her advice. She'd take it from you.

532
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,590
何出此言
What makes you say that?

533
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,120
因为她明白你所做的都是为她好
Because she knows you only want the best for her.

534
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,570
-我今晚要去酒吧  -什么时候
- I'm going down to the pub tonight. - When?

535
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,360
晚餐之后  我无聊死了  得活动活动
After our supper. I'm bored. I want to stretch my legs.

536
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
没得批准你不能去  今天不是你休假
You can't go to the pub without permission. It's not your day off.

537
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,610
我连散个步都不行吗
I can go for a walk, can't I?

538
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,340
-我可不敢用那个  -别这么胆小
- I could never do that. - Don't be so soft.

539
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,270
我就是不敢  老觉得自己会被电死
I couldn't. I'd keep thinking I were going to be electrocuted.

540
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,770
-你该多点信心  -该多点勇气才对
- You should have more faith. - I should have more courage!

541
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,360
来点酒后之勇如何  艾薇
How about some Dutch courage, Ivy?

542
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,640
今晚和我一起去吧
Why not come with me, tonight?

543
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,220
什么  让我去酒吧
What? Me go to a pub?

544
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,180
还不告假  你疯了吧
Without leave? You must be mad.

545
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,610
有什么大不了  你这辈子就没想过冒点险吗
What's the matter? Don't you ever want to take a chance in life?

546
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,740
我们什么时候会回来
When would we be back?

547
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,400
-你不是真想去吧  -我不知道
- You're not thinking of going?! - I don't know.

548
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,500
我从没坏过规矩
I never do anything I'm not supposed to.

549
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,710
-坏什么规矩  -没什么
- What are you not supposed to do? - Nothing.

550
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,580
-那边是怎么回事  -我在为晚餐做慕斯
- What's going on there? - I'm making the mousse for tonight.

551
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,340
我的天  我们最好再预备点汤
Oh, my God. Well, we'd better have some soup put by.

552
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,960
我可信不过那小玩意儿
I'd rather not rely on that contraption.

553
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,130
-需要帮忙吗  -你会帮忙就好了
- Can I help you? - I doubt you would if you could.

554
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,580
你说什么
I'm sorry?

555
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,790
你为什么没把我对鸡蛋的要求转达给帕特莫太太
Why didn't you give my instructions to Mrs Patmore about the eggs?

556
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,070
因为我不想
Because I didn't feel like it.

557
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,700
再说  为什么茜玻小姐的茶点里不能有蛋呢
Besides, why can't Miss Sybbie have an egg to her tea?

558
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,800
我不必事事都向你禀报
I don't have to explain my decisions to you.

559
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,800
你在这里干活
You're a member of staff,

560
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,580
我说的话都得听
and the orders I give are to be obeyed.

561
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,680
你不也在这里干活吗
And aren't you a member of staff?

562
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,670
和你不一样
Not in that way.

563
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,680
我得回楼上干活儿了
Now, I believe I'm needed upstairs.

564
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,220
我能进来吗
May I come in?

565
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,250
卡森
Carson?

566
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,440
进来吧
Of course.

567
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,270
我先走了  小姐
I'll leave you now, m'lady.

568
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,890
有什么事吗
What can I do for you?

569
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,490
我不知道该怎么开口
Well, I'm not sure how to start,

570
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,470
但在我开口之前
but before I do,

571
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,600
您得知道  我是为了您好
you must know that I would only be as bold as this

572
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,930
才会如此大胆
if I felt it was for your benefit.

573
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,160
现在你吓到我了
Now you're frightening me.

574
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,040
夫人
Your ladyship...

575
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,740
-您有空吗  -怎么了  巴罗
- Do you have a moment? - What is it, Barrow?

576
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,820
我担心一件事  夫人  我...
There's something's worrying me, m'lady and I...

577
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,220
-我实在忍不住了  -怎么了  发生什么事了
- But I can't hold it in any more. - Why? What's happened?

578
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,810
是维斯特保姆
It's Nanny West.

579
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,180
她好像对孩子们
I'm afraid it seems she's been leaving the children

580
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,670
不管不顾
to their own devices.

581
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,690
什么  你是说她不管他们
What? You mean she's neglecting them?

582
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,090
如果不是因为牵涉到两个孩子的安危
I wouldn't have spoken up if it weren't for a...

583
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,840
我是不会说出这件事的
..a little girl and a baby boy being put at risk.

584
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,660
-卡森  这是我的错  -小姐
- Carson, this is my fault. - My lady?

585
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,820
恐怕我让你觉得
I'm afraid I may have encouraged you to feel

586
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,660
你有权用这种口气和我说话
you have the right to address me in this way.

587
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,510
老爷做出了决定
His lordship has made a decision

588
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,900
我很难接受他的管家居然会因此指责他
and I find it hard that his butler should criticise him for it.

589
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,360
不  我不是说
No, I never meant...

590
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,830
你好像并不了解
You do not seem to understand

591
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,060
卡劳利先生的死对我造成了何种影响
the effect Mr Crawley's death has had on me.

592
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,690
至于管理庄园  我不知从何下手
As for managing the estate, I wouldn't know where to start.

593
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,870
但是布兰森先生相信您可以帮上大忙  小姐
But Mr Branson believes you could be very helpful, my lady,

594
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,340
他是代理人  应该很清楚
and as the agent, he should know.

595
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,510
他只是担心老爷会回到老路上
He's just nervous that his lordship will retreat to his old ways

596
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,100
放弃马修先生的改革措施
and abandon all Mr Matthew's reforms.

597
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,200
他会这样做吗
And will he?

598
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,970
如果他做了  你会不赞同吗
If he did, wouldn't you approve?

599
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,970
总之  不管你赞同与否
Anyway, whether you approve or not,

600
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,290
你不该觉得自己有权逾越界限
I'm sorry you feel entitled to overstep the mark.

601
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,940
小姐
My lady?

602
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,330
我们是老朋友了
We're old friends,

603
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,260
我也说过了  我相信这次过失我们都有责任
and as I said, I'm sure this lapse is as much my fault as yours.

604
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,470
但是我建议我们不再提起这事
But, I suggest we don't mention it again.

605
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,640
我先走一步  该下去了
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to go down.

606
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,960
您这是任凭自己被打败  小姐
You're letting yourself be defeated, my lady.

607
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,280
如果这样说是"过失"  那我很抱歉
I'm sorry if it's a "Lapse" to say so,

608
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,550
但总得有人说
but someone has to.

609
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,540
佃户午餐准备的怎么样了
How is the luncheon for the tenant farmers coming along?

610
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,040
-我觉得很好  -汤姆
- Well, I think. - Tom?

611
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,150
他们都接受了  除了惠勒伍德的巴恩斯
They've all accepted except for Barnes at Wheelers Wood.

612
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,600
他得去参加妹妹的婚礼
He's sworn to his sister's wedding.

613
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,380
我觉得我们可以原谅他
I think we can forgive him.

614
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,740
我总觉得我的安排冲突了
You know, I have a terrible feeling I've double booked.

615
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,140
是这周六  对吗
It's this Saturday, isn't it?

616
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,060
别担心  我们不请太太
Don't worry. We're not having the wives.

617
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,340
伊迪丝可以主持
Edith can preside.

618
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,350
恐怕不行  我要去伦敦
I can't I'm afraid. I'm going up to London.

619
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,140
-那就玛丽吧  -我
- Mary, then. - Me?

620
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,490
如果乔治现在拥有一半庄园
Well, if George is owner of half the estate now,

621
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,000
难道你不该代表他吗
shouldn't you represent him?

622
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,680
-我  -我不想麻烦玛丽
- Well, I... - I don't want to bother Mary.

623
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,770
-他们会想见到你的  -是的  但是
- They'd like to see you. - I'm sure they would but...

624
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,500
毕竟  如果罗伯特有所不测  得由你来管理
After all, you'll have to run it if anything happens to Robert.

625
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,970
直到乔治成年  或者更久
Until George is of age, or longer.

626
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,840
天啊  为什么大家都来唠叨我
For heaven's sake! Why does everyone keep nagging and nagging?

627
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,960
我丈夫死了  你们难道不懂那是什么意思吗
My husband is dead! Can't you understand what that means?

628
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,620
连战争他都挺过来了
After all he suffered in the war,

629
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,180
他居然死于一场愚蠢的车祸
he's killed in a stupid car crash!

630
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,610
马修死了  他还能再活五十年的
Matthew is dead, 50 years before his time!

631
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,380
难道这还不够我心烦的吗
Isn't that enough for me to deal with?

632
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,300
别来烦我
Just leave me alone!

633
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,410
我就怕这样
Exactly what I was afraid of.

634
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,270
她现在身处噩梦之中
She is living a nightmare.

635
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,910
我们必须都后退
We must all step back and

636
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,030
让她自己慢慢恢复过来
allow her to come through it in her own time.

637
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,120
我说得对吧  妈妈
Aren't I right, Mama?

638
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,630
不对  我们现在不能讨论
No. We can't discuss it now.

639
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,870
慕斯美味极了  卡森  是帕特莫太太做的吗
This mousse is delicious, Carson, is it the work of Mrs Patmore?

640
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,930
想必不是她买来的吧
I suppose she hasn't bought it in?

641
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,530
不是  夫人
I don't think so, your ladyship, no.

642
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,600
那你记得告诉她很美味
Then you must be sure to send her our compliments.

643
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,990
怎么了  儿子  觉得不舒服吗
What's the matter, lad? Are you not feeling well?

644
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,870
不是
No, it's not that.

645
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,480
我不知道  爸爸  只是
Oh, I don't know, Dad. It's just...

646
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,790
只是最近我
It's just lately I...

647
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,660
我不知道我未来会怎样  我
I can't seem to see where I'm going, I'm...

648
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,320
你受到了打击  这样并不奇怪
You've had a shock, and no wonder.

649
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,110
你本该服侍马修先生  一直到老去
You should have been working for Mr Matthew until you were old,

650
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,080
也许还能做到庄园的管家
maybe been butler at the Abbey before you were done.

651
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,130
现在一切都没了  你的薪水也随之而去
Now all that's gone, and your wages with it.

652
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,770
他是个好人  爸爸
He were a nice chap, Dad.

653
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,780
不管我们有什么分歧
You know, whatever the difference between us,

654
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,890
他总是彬彬有礼  和蔼可亲
he were always polite, always kind.

655
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,070
很高兴听到你这样说
I'm glad to hear it.

656
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,690
但是这提高了我的标准  你知道吗
But, it's raised my standards, do you see?

657
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,390
老夫人想让我
I mean, who is this old...bat

658
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,890
周五见的这女人是谁啊
her ladyship wants me to meet on Friday?

659
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,240
听我说
Now, listen.

660
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,550
做你这行
In your game,

661
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,770
想服侍最好的主人  就得做最好的仆人
if you want the best, you've got to be the best.

662
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,410
努力争取
And work at it!

663
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,400
去重新找份好工作
Get yourself back into service, in a good post.

664
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,160
很快你就能找到方法去实现你的目标
And you'll soon find your way to where you'd like to be.

665
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,530
我要走了
I'm leaving.

666
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,530
我不想不告而别
I didn't want to run off without saying good night.

667
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,890
您大概觉得我刚才举止很不得体吧
I suppose you think I behaved very badly down there.

668
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,860
亲爱的  你举止是否得体
My dear, I'm not really very interested

669
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,320
我并不在乎
in whether you behaved badly or well.

670
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,540
-不吗  -不
- No? - No.

671
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,750
我不是你的家庭教师  我是你奶奶
I am not your governess. I'm your grandmother.

672
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,090
-哪里不同  -不同在于
- And the difference is? - The difference is...

673
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,290
我爱你
I love you.

674
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,300
我知道
Of course you do.

675
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,770
抱歉
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,690
玛丽  你很痛苦
Mary, you've gone through a hideous time.

677
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,270
但现在你得为你儿子着想
But now you must remember your son.

678
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,000
他非常需要你
He needs you...very much.

679
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,670
我知道
I know.

680
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,220
老实说  我不觉得我会是个称职的母亲
The truth is, I don't think I'm going to be a very good mother.

681
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,640
为什么呢
Why not?

682
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,130
因为不知怎么了  马修死后
Because somehow, with Matthew's death,

683
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,460
他在我身上看到的温柔
all the softness that he found in me

684
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,950
好像慢慢消失了
seems to have dried up and drained away.

685
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,700
或许那本来就是他的想象
Maybe it was only ever there in his imagination.

686
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,600
亲爱的
Now, my dear...

687
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,850
称职的母亲分很多种
..There's more than one type of good mother.

688
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,370
事实上
The fact is,

689
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,230
你面前有两个选择
you have a straightforward choice before you.

690
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,840
你必须做出决定
You must choose...

691
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,680
是消沉避世  或是积极生活
..Either death...or life.

692
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,760
您认为我该选择生活吗
And you think I should choose life?

693
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,380
查理・格里格将住在卡劳利夫人那儿吗
Charlie Grigg is going to stay with Mrs Crawley?

694
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,950
他被放出来了  卡劳利夫人监管他
The authorities have released him into her charge.

695
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,070
我周五去接他
I'm collecting him on Friday.

696
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,500
为什么她会同意呢
But why has she agreed to this?

697
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,030
因为她很善良  他需要帮助
Because she is a kind woman, and he is a man in need.

698
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,690
我不敢相信
I cannot believe you are

699
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,860
你在这时候还打搅卡劳利夫人
imposing on Mrs Crawley at a time like this,

700
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,830
她经受着丧子之痛
when she is almost broken by grief.

701
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,050
就是因为这样  我才要打搅她
It's BECAUSE of her grief I am imposing.

702
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,340
-我不理解  -不
- I don't understand you. - No.

703
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,670
你不能理解
You wouldn't.

704
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,490
你得原谅玛丽
You must forgive Mary.

705
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,410
我原谅她了
I do forgive her.

706
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,650
她遍体鳞伤  我们得保护好她
She is broken and bruised and it is our job

707
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,810
让她不再受伤害
to wrap her up and keep her safe from the world.

708
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,680
不  罗伯特
No, Robert.

709
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,100
我们要让她重新面对这个世界
It is our job to bring her back to the world.

710
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,750
-我不这样认为  -真的吗
- I'm afraid that is not how I see it. - Really?

711
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,410
那我只能说
Then I can only say that

712
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,050
我可以不介意玛丽做的错误决定
while I will overlook Mary's poor judgement,

713
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,120
但你就不应该了
I find it hard to overlook yours.

714
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,610
晚安
Goodnight.

715
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:21,420
伊迪丝  伊迪丝  周五一起吃饭吧
Oh, Edith, Edith, come to luncheon on Friday.

716
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,320
-我...  -一定要来
- I... - I mean it.

717
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,660
我需要你的帮助才能成功
I need your help to make things a success.

718
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,350
为什么  我们要做什么
Why? What are we doing?

719
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,630
我们要把莫斯利介绍给沙克尔顿夫人
We are selling Molesley to Lady Shackleton.

720
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,340
是介绍他去做仆人
You mean as a servant?

721
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,230
不  介绍他去洗衣服  
No. As a Chinese laundryman

722
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,610
幸好你是一个人  你得帮我
Thank God you're alone. You've got to help me.

723
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,450
你们俩怎么了
What's the matter with you two?

724
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,130
不知道  我跟着他去看看吧
I don't know, but I'd better go with him if I want to find out.

725
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,390
天啊  你怎么了
Oh, my Lord, what have you done?

726
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,940
她在酒吧喝高了
She got a bit tiddly down the pub.

727
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,580
-她不是喝高了  她都醉了  -他一直买酒
- She's not tiddly. She's drunk! - He kept buying them.

728
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,530
-你想做什么  -我没想做什么
- What were you trying to do? - Nothing.

729
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,370
她只是很少喝酒
She's just not used to it.

730
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,590
走吧
Come on.

731
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,880
-怎么回事  -艾薇不舒服
- What on earth?! - Ivy's not very well.

732
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,150
岂止是不舒服啊  快扶她进来
That's the understatement of the year. Bring her inside.

733
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,970
-帕特莫太太睡了吗  -应该睡了  谢天谢地 	
- Has Mrs Patmore gone to bed? - She must have, thank goodness.

734
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,330
-你想做什么  -我没想做什么
- What were you trying to do? - I wasn't trying to do anything.

735
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,950
最好是这样
As long as you weren't.

736
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,380
来擦脸
Here.

737
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,480
-感觉怎样  -好点了  谢谢
- How are you feeling? - A bit better, thank you.

738
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,070
你差点闯大祸了
You could have done real damage.

739
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,270
-跟我来  -贝茨先生怎么办
- You come along with me now. - What about Mr Bates?

740
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,060
他不会找你吗
Won't he be missing you?

741
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,480
贝茨先生得等着了
Mr Bates must wait his turn.

742
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
我真不是存心的  艾薇  
Meant no harm, Ivy, honest.

743
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,920
你不会把这事说出去吧
You won't say anything about this, will you?

744
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,210
当然不会
'Course not.

745
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,380
来吧
Come on.

746
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,630
我不是故意的
It wasn't deliberate, you know.

747
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,530
我知道你假装喜欢她来让我难堪
I know you only pretend to like her to tease me.

748
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,260
为什么你不告诉她  那张卡不是你寄的
Why don't you tell her you didn't send that card?

749
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,340
早安  卡劳利夫人  我不知道您来了
Oh good morning, Mrs Crawley. I didn't know you were here.

750
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,250
阿尔弗雷德让我进来的
Alfred let me in.

751
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,390
我来见我孙子
I wanted to see Master George,

752
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,220
不过维斯特保姆觉得现在不合适
but I'm afraid...Nanny West didn't think it a good time.

753
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,700
卡劳利夫人
Oh, er, Mrs Crawley...

754
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,380
我听说您要收留格里格先生
I understand you are offering shelter to Mr Grigg.

755
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,280
对  他今天下午就到
Yes. He's arriving this afternoon.

756
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,130
只是  我不希望您是为了我
Only I should hate to feel you were doing this

757
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,140
才这么做的
out of consideration for me.

758
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,400
格里格先生完全能处理好自己的事情
Mr Grigg is perfectly capable of managing his own affairs.

759
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,290
可他都落魄到救济院了
Not very successfully if he ends up in a workhouse.

760
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,970
我只是不希望您把精力和善心浪费在
I just don't want you to waste your energy and kindness

761
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,280
不值得的人身上
on an unworthy recipient.

762
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,310
起码不是这种时候
Not at such a time.

763
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,800
我懂
I understand.

764
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,460
不过  卡森
But you see, Carson,

765
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,440
我差点要忘记自己还有精力和善心了
I'd almost forgotten I had either energy or kindness in me.

766
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,170
这不是很让人欣慰吗
So that's something, isn't it?

767
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,350
-她为什么要去里彭见她  -不知道
- Why is she seeing her in Ripon? - I don't know.

768
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,670
夫人不等广告结果了吗
Her ladyship won't wait for the advertisement?

769
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,080
要是这位不合格  她会继续等  
She will if this one's no good,

770
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,130
但她想赶快办妥
but she wants to get on with it.

771
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,700
你感觉怎么样了  艾薇
How are you, Ivy?

772
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,250
不太好
Not wonderful.

773
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,300
谁都有年轻的时候
I suppose we were all young once.

774
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,230
对  不过你永葆青春
Yes, but you stayed young.

775
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,010
这点跟别人不一样
That's the difference.

776
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,900
不好意思  布雷思韦特小姐
Forgive me, Miss Braithwaite,

777
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,160
我总觉得自己以前见过你
but I have the strangest feeling I've seen you before.

778
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,740
是的  我正准备提这件事
Well, yes. I was just coming to that.

779
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,860
我曾经在唐顿庄园做过工  不过时间很短
You see, I worked at Downton Abbey, but only for a short time.

780
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,750
为什么呢
Why was that?

781
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,720
我当时做的是女仆  夫人
I was a housemaid then, m'lady,

782
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,120
我觉得该做点更有难度的工作
and I was starting to feel it was time to move on.

783
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,340
是这样啊
I see.

784
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,680
我报名上了美发课  我还会做针线活
So, I took a course in hairdressing, and I could always sew.

785
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,650
后来你做了贴身女仆
And you got a job as a lady's maid.

786
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,190
是的  夫人  但只做了几个月
I did, m'lady, but it only lasted for a few months

787
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,700
因为我侍奉的老夫人去世了
because the old lady I was working for died.

788
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,430
真遗憾
I am sorry.

789
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,750
我知道自己的资历不深  夫人
I know I don't sound very experienced, m'lady,

790
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,270
但我很勤快  而且我还练过手了
but I'm a very hard worker and I've practised what I've learned.

791
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,870
要是你之前在唐顿做过工的话
Well, I shall obviously have to talk to Mrs Hughes

792
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,710
我得问一下休斯太太
if you've worked for us before.

793
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,430
我走的时候  她还给我写了封很不错的推荐信呢
She gave me a wonderful reference. When I left.

794
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,720
这点确实很有说服力
That does seem very encouraging.

795
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
快答应吧  柯拉堂亲
Please say yes, Cousin Cora.

796
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,100
你真的想做这份工作吗
You definitely want the position?

797
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,930
是的  夫人  我很喜欢唐顿这个地方
Oh, I do, m'lady. I enjoyed Downton ever so much.

798
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,490
我当时只是觉得那份工作没太有挑战性
It was just that the work wasn't sufficiently demanding.

799
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,610
你什么时候能上岗
When would you be able to start?

800
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,310
听您吩咐  夫人
Whenever you want me, your ladyship.

801
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,670
-你能安排好你姨妈的事吗  -我姨妈
- You can make arrangements for your aunt? - My aunt?

802
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,570
你不就是因为要照顾她
I thought that was why you couldn't

803
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,940
才不能去唐顿面试吗
come to Downton for the interview.

804
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,660
抱歉  是这样的  
I'm sorry. Of course it was.

805
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,720
我能得到这份工作都有点晕头了
I'm quite dizzy I've got the job.

806
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,180
我能安排好我姨妈的事
Erm, yes, I can make arrangements for my aunt.

807
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,080
您用不着担心
Don't worry about that.

808
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,980
那就这么定了
It's settled, then.

809
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,390
我一个人完全可以为三位夫人侍奉午餐
I'm perfectly capable of serving luncheon to three ladies.

810
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,990
你来做什么
So, why are you here?

811
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,740
我觉得她想把我介绍给沙克尔顿夫人
I've an idea that she wants to introduce me to Lady Shackleton.

812
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,730
这不是你自己的主意吗
Are you sure this isn't your idea?

813
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,830
是不是你让老夫人为你做引荐
I wonder if you haven't pushed her ladyship into it,

814
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,620
这样你就可以在她面前出风头了
so you could just show off in front of her.

815
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,210
当然不是
Certainly not!

816
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,630
我觉得你想抢我的位置
I think it's my job you're after!

817
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,540
-这根本就与沙克尔顿夫人无关  -才不是呢
- Nothing to do with Lady Shackleton. - No!

818
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,200
我凭什么信你
So you say.

819
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,070
我要去宣布开饭了
Well, I'm going to announce luncheon.

820
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,160
我警告你  别打其他主意了
But I'm warning you. That's all.

821
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,720
我儿子告诉我  撤销农产品补贴的决定
My son tells me that this decision to remove the farm subsidies

822
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,640
对全国上下的地产打击非常大
has dealt a terrible blow to landed estates up and down the country.

823
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,080
那个劳合・乔治先生太过分了
That awful Mr Lloyd George.

824
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,350
我也这么觉得
I agree.

825
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,690
我时常怀疑他是不是德国人
You know, I sometimes wonder if he isn't really German,

826
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,110
只是假装成威尔士人而已
just pretending to be Welsh.

827
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,480
见到你真高兴  莫斯利
It's nice to see you here, Molesley.

828
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,510
莫斯利一直都在勤勤恳恳地扶持这个家
Molesley's always been a great supporter of the family.

829
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,720
真好
That's good to hear.

830
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,330
是啊  我和奶奶经常说
Oh, yes, Granny and I are always saying

831
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,240
-莫斯利最可靠了  -没人比得上他
- there's no-one more reliable than Molesley. - No-one.

832
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,760
小心点  莫斯利先生
Careful, Mr Molesley!

833
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,970
你没事吧  莫斯利
Oh? Are you quite well, Molesley?

834
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,230
没事  老夫人
Yes, your ladyship.

835
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,680
你在伦敦做什么  伊迪斯
What are you doing in London, Edith dear?

836
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,820
就是见一些人
Oh you know, seeing people.

837
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,220
你用不着大喊大叫吧  我又没做错什么
There's no need to shout! I wasn't doing anything wrong.

838
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,080
我还以为你要失手掉到地上了
It looked to me as if you were about to drop it.

839
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,310
-我没有  -那就好
- Well, I wasn't. - Very well.

840
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,920
给  上这道菜
Here, take this.

841
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,850
莫斯利  你怎么了
Molesley?

842
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:11,110
对不起  老夫人
I'm sorry, m'lady.

843
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,360
我不知道这个盘子这么烫
I didn't realise the plate was so hot.

844
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,210
可怜人  他似乎没怎么做过这些呢
Poor man. He seems quite new to this kind of work.

845
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,280
是吗
Does he?

846
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,290
不不  不是这样的  这正是莫斯利的优点
Oh, but that is, no dear no, that is Molesley's strength.

847
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,540
他总是愿意迎接挑战
You see he is always ready for a challenge.

848
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,830
那您允许他做这样的尝试真是太好心了
I think it was very kind of you to allow him to have a go at it.

849
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,070
嗯  我们也是尽力而为嘛
Yes well, we, we try to do our best.

850
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,930
如今有很多人不得不做一些
I do find it very hard these days to see how many men

851
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,360
他们力所不能及的事  真是难为他们了
are forced to take employment for which they are quite unsuited.

852
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,620
希望你能尽快回去做你的本职
I hope you'll soon get back to whatever it is you're trained for.

853
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,180
来吧  格里格先生  休斯太太把你的事都告诉我了
Come in, Mr Grigg. Mrs Hughes has told me all about you.

854
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,910
谢谢您  卡劳利夫人
Thank you, Mrs Crawley.

855
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,750
查理来没来啊
I was er... I was wondering if Charlie might be here.

856
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,300
-查理・卡森  -没有  卡森先生很忙
- Charlie Carson. - No. Mr Carson's very busy.

857
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,020
但我会转告他你安全到达了
But, I'll tell him that you've arrived safely.

858
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,980
但他知道我要来吧
But, he does know I'm coming here?

859
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,080
我们昨天谈过了
We talked of it yesterday.

860
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,890
我给你放了洗澡水
Now, I've run a bath

861
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,610
还在教堂找到了些募捐的干净衣物
and dug out some clean clothes from the missionary barrel.

862
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,330
应该会合身  回头再去弄些更好的衣服来
They should fit you, at least until we can find something better.

863
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,390
这边走  格里格先生
This way, Mr. Grigg.

864
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:50,200
-您太好了  -哪里的话  这不算什么
- You're very kind. - Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

865
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,840
我去安排他住下
While I'm sorting him out,

866
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,550
你去一趟厨房
I wondered if you'd look in at the kitchen

867
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,250
告诉菲尔德太太他来了
and tell Mrs Field he's arrived

868
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,220
拿托盘把午餐端给他  好吗
and to put his luncheon on a tray.

869
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,200
我觉得他今天该卧床休息
I think he should stay in bed today

870
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,270
然后再做打算
and then we can see where we are.

871
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,070
他说得对  您真是好心
He's right. You're very kind.

872
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,840
不不  我们都得尽力而为嘛
No, no. We must all do what we can.

873
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,590
你好啊
Hello.

874
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,520
你可...真美
You look...very glamorous.

875
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,900
我觉得我该好好打扮一下
I thought I'd make a bit of an effort.

876
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,430
真是太好了
I'm glad you did.

877
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,040
我点了些酒
I've ordered some wine for us.

878
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,840
天呐  真奢侈呢
Heavens, how spoiling.

879
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,820
我很喜欢这里
I love the Criterion.

880
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,040
感觉好疯狂
It feels so wild.

881
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,960
跟一个男人出来私会
To be out with a man,

882
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,150
在伦敦的奢华饭店吃饭喝酒
drinking and dining in a smart London restaurant.

883
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,990
别说十年前  就是五年前  你能想象
Can you imagine being allowed to do anything of the sort

884
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,090
做这样的事吗
five years ago, never mind ten?

885
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,740
战争改变了一切
The war changed everything.

886
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,940
妈妈曾说我们绝不会在公共场所吃饭的
Mama used to say we could never eat anywhere public,

887
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,190
除非是我们下榻的酒店
except an hotel we were staying in.

888
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,410
她可能会带我们去丽兹酒店  但也就那样了
She might cheat and take us to the Ritz, but that was about it.

889
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,290
我好爱你
I do love you so.

890
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,570
是吗
Do you?

891
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,760
那真好
I'm glad.

892
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,210
我们就是为此庆祝吗
Is that what we're celebrating?

893
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,040
对  还有我取得的进展
That, and my progress.

894
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,190
我发现我可以在德国跟莉兹离婚
I've found out I can divorce Lizzie in Germany,

895
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,900
前提是我成为德国公民
if I become a German citizen.

896
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:54,130
你愿意为我成为德国人
You're willing to become a German citizen, for me?

897
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,830
你真愿意这么做
You'd do that?

898
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,510
如果我能娶你  我愿意成为爱斯基摩人
I'd become an Eskimo if it meant I could marry you.

899
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,520
但是  德国
But...Germany?

900
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,510
我们打了四年的仗
After four years of fighting,

901
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,360
你愿意为我加入欧洲最令人仇视的民族吗
you'd join the most hated race in Europe for me?

902
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,870
我能吻你吗
Can I kiss you?

903
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,540
在这儿吗
What, here?

904
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,300
-当着这么多人的面  -我不在乎
- In front of all these people? - I don't care.

905
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,940
吻我吧
Kiss me. Now.

906
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,430
艾德娜・布雷思韦特要回来了
Edna Braithwaite is coming back?

907
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,010
我本想先跟你商量  但是
I would have talked it over with you first but...

908
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,300
我看到你给她写了那么好的一份推荐信
When I saw that wonderful reference you wrote her.

909
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,960
是  可那是因为
Yes, but that was because...

910
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,190
我给她写了一份好推荐信
I wrote her a good reference

911
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,690
因为我觉得她干活儿勤快利索
because I thought she was a good worker,

912
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,920
但我不觉得她能当好贴身女仆
but I don't see her as a lady's maid.

913
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,730
您不能等到收到广告回复之后
Couldn't you wait for the replies to the advertisement, m'lady,

914
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,420
再做决定吗  夫人
before coming to a decision?

915
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,820
真没想到  休斯太太
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

916
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,420
你真要阻止我帮助一个努力勤快的女孩吗
Do you want to prevent my giving a hard-working woman a helping hand?

917
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,620
那张卡的确是吉米寄给艾薇的
You know, it WAS Jimmy sent that card to Ivy.

918
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,880
这你又不确定
You don't know that.

919
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,140
我想没错
I think I do.

920
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,850
可如果是他  那么我那张就是阿尔弗寄的
But, if it were him, then Alfie must have sent mine.

921
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,010
阿尔弗雷德  跟我来
Alfred. Come with me.

922
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,730
-什么事  -你管呢  来就是了
- Why? - Never you mind. Just come along.

923
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,520
莫斯利先生
Mr Molesley?

924
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,800
你要来点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

925
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,290
-来杯茶  -不不  不麻烦你了
- A cup of tea? - No. I don't want to be a bother.

926
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,190
那顿午餐怎么样  伊迪丝小姐告诉我了
How was the famous luncheon? Lady Edith told me all about it.

927
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,210
之前还是之后说的
Was that before or after?

928
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,360
之前
Before.

929
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,320
那就这样吧  别再多说了
Right. Let's just leave it at that, shall we?

930
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,290
休斯太太在找我
Mrs Hughes was looking for me.

931
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,630
我看见她会休息室了  要我去叫她吗
I saw her go into her sitting room. Shall I fetch her?

932
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,450
不必了
No need.

933
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,040
很抱歉我之前没说
I'm sorry not to have mentioned it.

934
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,180
是我给艾薇寄了卡片
I sent the card to Ivy.

935
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,280
但是  吉米说
But...Jimmy said...

936
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,620
他没寄
He didn't send one.

937
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,270
如果他寄了  也没寄给唐顿的人
Or, if he did, it wasn't to anyone at Downton.

938
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,390
晚安  帕特莫太太
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

939
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,300
如果不是他  那是谁寄了卡片给我
If it weren't him, then who did send my card?

940
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,120
我这下睡不着了
I won't sleep now.

941
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,940
老天啊  是我寄的
Oh, for heaven's sake! I sent it.

942
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,870
-你  -对
- You?! - Yes.

943
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,700
我猜到阿尔弗雷德会给艾薇寄一张
I thought Alfred would buy one for Ivy,

944
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,190
如果他寄了  我不希望你什么都没收到
and I didn't want you to have nothing to open if he did.

945
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,520
如果我不该这么做  那很抱歉
I'm sorry if I did wrong.

946
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,200
不  别这么说
No, don't be sorry.

947
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,600
我虽然没有人暗恋  但至少有个好朋友
I may not have a follower, but at least I've got a friend.

948
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,220
晚安  帕特莫太太
Goodnight, Mrs Patmore.

949
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,910
我真不知道该怎么说
I didn't know what else to say.

950
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,310
我的确给她写了份好推荐信
I had written her a good reference.

951
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,800
但那是因为我求您
Only because I asked you to.

952
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,440
那我该告诉夫人吗  布兰森先生
And was I to tell her that, Mr Branson,

953
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,100
还有您提出要求的原因
and why you asked me?

954
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,830
我去告诉她吧
It's up to me to tell her.

955
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,800
是我搅起了这场麻烦
I'm the one who got us into this fix.

956
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,860
不
No.

957
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,030
夫人失去了一个女儿和一个女婿
Her ladyship has lost a daughter and a son-in-law.

958
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,500
我不能让她觉得茜玻小姐的丈夫做了有失体面的事
I cannot now let her think that Lady Sybil's husband was unworthy.

959
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,740
这对她会难以承受
It's too much.

960
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,830
那我们怎么做
Then what are we to do?

961
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,660
-不能留她在这儿  -不行也得行
- We can't have her here. - We must.

962
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,500
我们让她回来
We'll let her come back

963
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,350
并且保证她不会逾矩
and we'll make sure that she behaves herself.

964
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,850
如果她不守规矩呢
And if she doesn't?

965
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,150
我们得盯紧了她
We must keep a firm eye on her,

966
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,900
希望我们可以指望你
and I hope we may rely on you

967
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,350
确保艾德娜不会做什么出格的事
to see that Edna doesn't step out of line.

968
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,690
当然
Of course.

969
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,730
毕竟  她似乎的确接受了专业的训练
After all, she does appear to have acquired some proper training.

970
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,410
这应该不假
I don't think that's a lie.

971
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:05,330
或许她变得现实了
Maybe she's moved into the real world.

972
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:10,680
我觉得就是颗定时炸弹
Well, it all sounds like a ticking bomb to me.

973
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:29,160
好了  我的好宝贝
There, there, my precious boy,

974
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:35,290
别让那司机的女儿再打扰你了
and don't let that chauffeur's daughter disturb you any more.

975
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,240
给我睡觉
Go back to sleep,

976
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,100
你个小杂种
you wicked little cross-breed.

977
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,930
夫人  我没看见您
Your ladyship... I didn't see you there.

978
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,760
显然如此
Obviously not.

979
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,160
我就是...
I was just er...

980
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,680
我就是跟茜玻小姐闹着玩呢
I was just having a game with Miss Sybbie.

981
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,550
我要你今晚收拾东西  明天一早就走
I want you to pack tonight and leave first thing in the morning.

982
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,650
但是  夫人
But, your ladyship...

983
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,310
请把乔治少爷放回摇篮里
Please put Master George back into his crib.

984
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,180
你不许再碰两个孩子了
You are not to touch the children again.

985
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,980
我以为是维斯特保姆按的铃呢
Oh. I thought it was Nanny West ringing.

986
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,740
不  休斯太太  维斯特保姆明早就会走了
No, Mrs Hughes, Nanny West is leaving in the morning.

987
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,730
请你为她找张床  让她今晚过夜
Can you find her a bed for the night

988
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,380
找一个女仆来陪孩子睡
and ask one of the maids to sleep with the children?

989
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,550
但是  夫人  我就是说笑呢
But, your ladyship, I was only joking.

990
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,610
我不想再说了
I prefer not to discuss it,

991
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,480
除了告诉你
except to say that

992
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,520
你这样的观念在一个文明的家里待不下去
your values have no place in a civilised home!

993
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,810
好了  休斯太太
Now, Mrs Hughes...

994
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,840
维斯特保姆收拾东西的时候我就等在这儿
I'll wait here while Nanny West packs.

995
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,860
你去找个女仆来  再收拾一间房
You will fetch a maid and prepare a room.

996
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,410
要记住  不能让维斯特小姐跟孩子独处
You understand, Miss West is not to be left alone with the children.

997
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,950
一分钟也不行
Not for one minute.

998
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,980
不知道伊迪丝怎么样了
I wonder how Edith's getting on.

999
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,000
她去伦敦去得很频啊
She has quite a London life.

1000
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,320
-她在跟她的编辑约会  -是认真的吗
- She's seeing that publisher. - Is it serious?

1001
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:56,520
他长得不差  而且还喘气
Well, he's not bad looking and he's still alive,

1002
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,990
这样他与我们同龄的男士相比就有两项优势了
which puts him two points ahead of most men of our generation.

1003
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,880
可是她能找个比他更好的
Which doesn't alter the fact she could do a great deal better.

1004
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,200
-你了解他吗  -不怎么了解
- Do you know anything about him? - Not really.

1005
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,910
我们在唐依阁的时候  他跟马修谈过
He talked to Matthew a bit when we were at Duneagle...

1006
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,580
回房去吧
Go to bed.

1007
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,680
你看起来很疲惫
You look done in.

1008
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,410
明天的佃户午餐  您需要我去吗
Do you want me at the tenants' luncheon tomorrow?

1009
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,340
你不必出席
No, there's no reason for you to be.

1010
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,530
我知道您想保护我
I know you're trying to shield me...

1011
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,520
让我用自己的方式来打理吧
Let me manage things in my own way.

1012
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,370
听我的  这样最好
Please. It'll be for the best.

1013
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,650
我也有想法的  马修和我以前常常谈...
I have ideas, you know. Matthew and I used to talk...

1014
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,850
亲爱的  我知道我是对的
My dear, I know I'm right in this.

1015
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,280
去睡吧
Now, go to bed.

1016
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,110
小姐
My lady?

1017
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,360
抱歉这么晚来打搅你
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

1018
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,290
但我想你知道我为何事而来
but I think you know why I've come.

1019
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,020
-我是来道歉的  -您不必道歉
- To apologise. - You have nothing to apologise for.

1020
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,940
是我唐突了  说了不该说的话
I pushed into your room and I spoke impertinently.

1021
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,280
我想你知道奶奶赞同你的观点
I suppose you know my grandmother agrees with you.

1022
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,630
这我并不奇怪
That doesn't surprise me.

1023
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,270
这么说  您是决定
So, does this mean you've decided

1024
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,330
回到生活中来了吗
to return to the land of the living?

1025
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:44,740
如果是这样  我很高兴
Because, if so, I'm glad.

1026
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,110
我只是
It means that I

1027
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,930
意识到我已经颓废消沉太久了
know that I've spent too long in the land of the dead.

1028
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,680
我们都很喜欢卡劳利先生  小姐
We were very fond of Mr Crawley, you know, my lady.

1029
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,370
我们所有人
All of us.

1030
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,530
我
I...

1031
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,840
哭吧  小姐
You cry, m'lady.

1032
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,020
好好哭一场
You have a good cry.

1033
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,230
现在该把眼泪都流出来
That's what's needed now.

1034
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,850
等您准备好了
And when you're ready...

1035
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,670
就可以做您该做的了
..You can get to work.

1036
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,110
因为您很坚强
Because you are strong enough.

1037
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,330
您能承受这份考验
You're strong enough for the task.

1038
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,610
是吗  卡森
But am I, Carson?

1039
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,260
问题就在这儿  爸爸似乎不这么想
That's the point. Papa doesn't seem to think so.

1040
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,530
难道您不该为了卡劳利先生  保护他的遗志吗
Don't you owe it to Mr Crawley, to protect his work?

1041
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,920
努力维护他所做出的变革
To fight for the changes he made?

1042
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,250
让唐顿走上正确的道路
To steer Downton in the right direction?

1043
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,440
我知道我怀疑自己的时候
I know I can always count on you

1044
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,710
你肯定会为我鼓劲
for a draught of self-confidence whenever I start to doubt.

1045
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,630
我永远都在这儿
And you will always find one here.

1046
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,470
晚安  卡森
Good night, Carson.

1047
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,660
晚安  小姐
Good night, m'lady.

1048
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,300
我的天
Oh my gosh.

1049
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:42,260
这是怎么了
Ohh... What in God's name...?

1050
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,010
肯定是叉子放得不是地方
I must have put those ruddy prongs in wrong.

1051
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,830
你肯定有什么没做对
You did something wrong.

1052
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,970
今天可真够精彩的
What a day this has turned out to be.

1053
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,020
怎么了
Why?

1054
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,600
维斯特保姆被解雇了
Nanny West has been sacked.

1055
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,180
明天有得说了
So, that's fun for tomorrow.

1056
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:58,260
如果有人看见了这个我也得被解雇了
Well, I'll get the sack if anyone sees this!

1057
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,340
让黛茜和艾薇早上来收拾吧
Let Daisy and Ivy clean it up in the morning.

1058
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,180
哪能让黛茜知道我不会使用这个
But Daisy mustn't find out I don't know how to work it.

1059
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,190
为什么
Why ever not?

1060
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,980
那样她就是未来
Because it makes her part of the future

1061
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,140
而我就被留在过去了  你还不明白吗
and leaves me stuck in the past, don't you see?

1062
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:16,400
给我件围裙  我们一起收拾
Oh... Fetch me an apron. We'll do it together.

1063
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,000
-真的吗  -有何不可
- Would you, really? - Why not?

1064
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,140
睡觉有什么好
Who needs sleep?

1065
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,150
谢谢
Thank you.

1066
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,610
-我一直不是很喜欢她  -维斯特保姆吗
- I was never sure I liked her. - Nanny West?

1067
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,540
虽然这事轮不到我说
It's not for me to have an opinion,

1068
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,210
但我还是要说
but I will say this...

1069
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,120
你昨晚去哪了
Where did you get to last night?

1070
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,380
我进来之前我就睡着了
I was fast asleep before you came in

1071
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,180
我走的时候你还在睡
and you were sleeping when I left.

1072
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,100
我的确睡得很晚
I'm afraid it was very late.

1073
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,100
但是你来得正好  我想告诉你
But I'm glad you're here now because I want you to know

1074
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,570
我们真是要好好感谢巴罗
that we owe a great debt to Barrow, here.

1075
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,060
我发现维斯特小姐非常不适合做保姆
It turns out Miss West is quite unsuited to the role of Nanny.

1076
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,370
-她今天就走人  -什么  又是这样
- She is leaving today. - What? Not another one.

1077
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,670
相信我  回头再说  我得走了  要迟了
Trust me. We'll talk about it later. I must run or I'll be late.

1078
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,560
巴罗  我是真心的  谢谢你
Barrow, I meant what I said. Thank you.

1079
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,360
我很高兴  夫人
I'm glad, your ladyship.

1080
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:31,330
我就是觉得她不是那么称职
I just had a hunch that she wasn't quite all Sir Garnet.

1081
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,530
这我不介意  你先测试一下就好
I've no problem, as long as you test them first.

1082
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,730
真抱歉没能去迎接大家
I'm so sorry to miss your arrival.

1083
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,090
没事  小姐  我们还没开席呢
That's all right, m'lady. We've not begun to eat.

1084
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,750
-来坐这儿吧  -我就坐这儿就好
- Come and sit here. - I'll manage very well at the end.

1085
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,870
卡森去给我搬个椅子来吧
Carson can find me a chair.

1086
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,890
坐这儿吧  我去那边坐
No. Sit here. I'll go to the end.

1087
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,150
这才是你该坐的地方
This is your place.

1088
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,070
你真的有这个时间吗
Are you sure you have time for this?

1089
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,480
当然
Quite sure.

1090
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,460
我一直很期待呢
I've been looking forward to it.

1091
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,780
泰勒先生
Now, Mr Taylor.

1092
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,020
你说要放弃牧羊是怎么回事
What's all this I hear about your giving up sheep?

1093
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,610
小姐  事情可不是那么简单
Well, m'lady, it's not quite as simple as that.

1094
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,580
说实话  我宁可放牧
If truth be told, I'd rather be farming livestock...

1095
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,550
为什么
And why is that?

1096

1098
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,560
放在办公室一本书里
Hidden in a book in the office.

1099
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,600
你是想逃避真相吗
Are you trying to hide from the truth?

1100
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:54,640
你更希望能独自经营唐顿
That you would prefer to be in sole charge of the estate.

1101
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,330
布雷思韦特和安娜之间有些矛盾
There's bad feeling between Braithwaite and Anna.

1102
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,160
-老爷  -安娜待她不太友善
- M'lord? - Anna has been a little unkind.

1103

1105
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,710
我们做这些要瞒着爸爸吗
Are we to do all this without telling Papa?

1106
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,650
待人接物  有些事不能说得太明白了
There can be too much truth in any relationship.

1107

罗斯小姐问我能不能陪她去俱乐部
Lady Rose asked me if I'd chaperone her to a The Dansant.
